class Interactor:
    """
    Interactor class is a parent class for interactive agents.
    In particular, it is a class that will have both a prover and a verifier
    subclass. The goal of writing it is to uniformize the methods that the
    prover and the verifier have in common. To initialize, it takes a circuit.
    The internal variables are the following:
        circ: a (deep) copy of the circuit. the point is both the prover and the
            verifier will have access to this, but they should be different copies
            because the prover will actually compute the circuit (which amounts
            to filling out various parts of the layers)
        d: depth
        p: prime
        k: a list of length d such that 2^k[i] is the size of layer i of the
            circuit
        random_vectors: a list of the random vectors for which the prover claims
            to know:
                                \tilde{W}_i(random_vectors[i])
            (this is the claim at the beginning of sumcheck at each layer)
            in layer i of the GKR, this round ends with prover claiming to know W_i+1(random_vectors). This is where this variable comes to use. So every element of vector has the length of k[i+1], which is the size of layer i+1.



        evaluations_of_random_vectors: a list of the prover's claimed evaluations:
            \tilde{W}_i(random_vectors[i]). The value of MLE evaluated at the random vector is stored at this. In verifier, when GKR starts, W_0 evaluated at the first random vector is stored here.

        sumcheck_random_elements: a list of lists. The ith list is the list of
            random elements the verifier has sent the prover to run the sumcheck
            protocol for layer i.
            NOTE: in sumcheck, the verifier sends nothing to the prover at step 0.
            in our convention, sumcheck_random_elements[i][j-1] is the randomness
            that the verifier sends after step j on layer i.

            Differentiate this with random_vectors. This is what the verifier sends to prover during the sumcheck protocol. Although the claim starts with W_i+1(k[i+1] random variables), during the sumcheck there are 2*k[i+1] random elements that the verifier sends to the prover. So the length of sumcheck_random_elements[i] is 2*k[i+1].


        polynomials: a list of lists of ``polynomials''. more precisely, the ith
            element is a list of the (quadratic) polynomials that the prover
            sends during sumcheck on layer i. Here, a polynomial is given by a list
            of integers of length 3 (they are quadratic): [a, b, c] corresponds to
            a + bx + cx^2. We know in every layer sumcheck, there will be a quadratic polynomial every time a variable is fixed. So polynomials[i] is a list containing all of the polys produced during the sumcheck protocol on layer i.
        lines: a list of ``lines''. more precisely, at the end of the layer i
            sumcheck, we reduce two eval_MLEs to a single one via linear
            interpolation. the ith entry of lines is a *function*
                F_p -> F_p^{k_{i+1}},
            which is the line between b* and c* and the end of layer i.
